This folder contains updates to the TI usb library as well as additional examples for the Tiva Launchpad. The USB additions allow you to build custom hid devices including multiple HID devices (example keyboard+mouse)

This is based on the Tivaware 1.0 codebase.

Some instructions for how to use are included in a PDF in the root of the directory - they are for an older version of the code so the instructions aren't exactly correct but you can still follow along.
